-- Idempotency ledger for inbound Zernio webhook deliveries. Zernio retries a
-- delivery with the same event id whenever our 200 doesn't arrive within its 5s
-- timeout; /api/webhooks/late claims the id here before processing so retries
-- and redeliveries never re-run a flow (which was double-sending DMs).
